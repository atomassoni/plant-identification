## Synopsis

This is an application that allows users to upload pictures and then search the GBIF species database for matching species. Other users can name the species in the pictures using the search results. It is set to work for all vascular plants right now, but would need only a little configuration to be an identification application for mushrooms, insects, birds, or any other grouping of organisms.

## Motivation

This project was created for a final project at Prime Digital Academy.
